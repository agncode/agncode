## Hi there, I'm Agung 👋

I'm an aspiring **Programmer** and **Illustrator** currently working as an **elementary school teacher**.  
Balancing code, creativity, and classroom life keeps me curious and constantly learning.

### 🚀 What I'm focusing on
- Learning modern programming fundamentals  
- Exploring web development & automation  
- Improving my digital art and character design  
- Creating simple projects that mix code + creativity

### 🎨 A little about me
I enjoy making cute characters, visual experiments, and small tools that help people create.  
Curiosity is my fuel — whether it's debugging or doodling.

### 📫 Let's connect
Feel free to check out my repos, give feedback, or collaborate on something fun!
